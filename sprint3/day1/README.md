# Matrix Addition

## Description Challenge 

    If we were to set up a Tic-Tac-Toe game, we would want to know whether the board's current state is solved, wouldn't we? Our goal is to create a function that will check that for us!

    Assume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array, where the value is 0 if a spot is empty, 1 if it is an "X", or 2 if it is an "O".
